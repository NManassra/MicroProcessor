# MicroProcessor
In this project, a simple part of a microprocessor is built. Firstly, two main blocks were built,
the ALU, and the register file, and some other helper modules as the vaiid_opcode_checker
After connecting them together, a very simple machine code was run on them, aslo some test 
benches for each module to make sure itâ€™s working correctly Student ID is written at each 
module (expect the modules labelled by Instructor). Using this code, the user can have an 
idea about how the microprocessor work. And the user will figure out the importance of each 
element. Note that in main, the design is synchronized to the rising edge of the clock only. 
But it would be easier if both rising and falling edged were used, but in practical life, only the 
rising edge of the clock which used in this project
